         Hello guys, you might be wondering why you get bullied, and thats exactly what im gonna tell you right now:The first reason is because they are jelous of you doing something great or good such as you are smarter than them, more talented than them, and much more handsome/beutiful than them  and much more things.

    my second reason is because some children have autism and disabilities. The bullies bully them because they can not do a certain thing such as walking or they have some mental problems such as they cannot speak propely, or have some sort of conditions like cannot go into the sun and having proplems cannot do basic tasks
