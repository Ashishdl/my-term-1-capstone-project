       Do  tell the closest and nicest adult that you are geting bullied , they may listen you, and they will go tell the bully not to bully you again.  most importantly you must tell your parents about the bully, because they love you and take care of you.
    </div>

    <div class="title23">
       Later  you see the bully who bullied you. And he is  hurt, getting bullied by some one else, and needing help , go ahead a help him . If you show your kindness to him , in the future he may be nice to you also. And if he still bullies you you must tell him firmly to stop.

    <div class="title23">
       When you are getting bullied you must NOT fight back or do anything to make the bully even more aggresove, or you may get several injuries and may end up going to a hospital or if it is very severe you may end up going to a judge or a council, so its better you dont fight back                                                            
    </div>

    <div class="title24">
       And if another day you are playing with you friends and you see the exact bully who bullied lonley , dont take revenge by going to him and bullying him like how he bullied you, instead he will do it back to you another time , so instead you can be nice to him and play with him.
